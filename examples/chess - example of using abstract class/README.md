# Chess - The example of using an abstract class

To run the application, it is necessary to open in the internet browser index.php.
This example represents the simple use of the abstract class in php. 4 classes were created: Figure, King, Pawn, Table.

* Table - This class preserves the positions of the figures on the plate and allows them to move.
* Figure - This class is an abstract class that contains only one method that checks if the move is valid.
* King and Pawn - They represent a certain figure. They include an abstract class and implement a function to check the validity of the move.

For further training, I recommend the addition of other figures as well as checking whether there was a collision (the possibility of one figure eating another).
